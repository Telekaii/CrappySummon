# CrappySummon!
A game idea I had that I never finished due to me not being able to Problem-Solve and just became Yandere Dev.  
Still WIP. No plans to turn this into a GUI. **CLI ftw**. (Although if I find the motivation to learn GUI, expect GUI update.)


### **If you want to download this game;**
- UNIX Operating System Recommended. Completely fine if you don't have it though.
- PLEASE Install binaries from [Actions](https://github.com/Telekaii/CrappySummon/actions).
