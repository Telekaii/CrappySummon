# CrappySummon
Old game idea I had that I never finished. Changed from MagicSummon to CrappySummon due to me not touching programming for 6 months.<br>
**I HIGHLY recommend you to install the artifact over at GitHub actions rather than any release.**<br>
There are currently no plans to turn this into GUI. Probably gonna be a CLI game until I found the motivation to turn it into GUI<br>
PRs are welcomed.<br>

Packages: [PromptUI](https://github.com/manifoldco/promptui) and [ProgressBar](https://github.com/schollz/progressbar)
