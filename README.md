# CrappySummon!
A game idea that I had a long time ago that I never finished due to me not being able to Problem-Solve and just became Yandere Dev.  
Still WIP. No plans to turn this into a GUI. **CLI ftw**. (Although if I find the motivation to learn GUI, expect GUI update.)


### **If you want to download this game;**
- No Windows Binaries because Windows bad for CLI.
- PLEASE Install binaries from [Actions](https://github.com/Telekaii/CrappySummon/actions).

## BUILDING
**Requirements: Go** (I'm not joking that's literally it)   
Steps:
- Clone or Download the repository
- Open Terminal and do the command ```go build ./...```
- If you're on a UNIX-like Operating System, you can mess around with GOOS and GOARCH environment variable to build in various different Operating System and Architecture.
